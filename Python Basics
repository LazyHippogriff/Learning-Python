#important functions
range(start,stop,step)
This function returns a list having elements from start to stop with step increment. start is included, stop is not included.

By default, start = 0 and step = 1, so you can use like below:
range(stop)-->It will return a list [0,1,2,...stop-1]
range(10,100)-->[10,11,12,...99]


#using for loops
#print first 10 whole numbers
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
  
#using while loops
i=0
while i<10:
  print(i)
  i+=1
  
#Booleans in python are True and False

#Brackets are optional in while and if statements' condition

#Just after while, you can have an else statement!!
