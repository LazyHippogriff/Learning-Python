#Tuple
#Tuples are immutable i.e. you can't change the individual elements after you've defined them. You can't add/remove elements as well. There's no append() or extend() method for tuples

l1 = "abc",4,"xyz",'c'
print("type(l1)-->",type(l1))
print("l1-->",l1)

#output
type(l1)--> <class 'tuple'>
l1--> ('abc', 4, 'xyz', 'c')

#List
#Lists are mutable. You can append
l2 = ["abc",'c',4,"xyz"]
print("type(l2)-->",type(l2))
print("l2-->",l2)

#output
type(l2)--> <class 'list'>
l2--> ['abc', 'c', 4, 'xyz']

#To define an empty tuple
l1 = ()

#To define an empty list
l2 = []


Most useful functions of list
list.extend(iterable) --> the extend() method takes an iterable such as list, tuple, string etc. and all the elements of iterable are added to the end of list. You can even use the same list as an input to the extend function.
#To extend a list.

l2.extend(l1)
print("l2-->",l2)

#output
l2--> ['abc', 'c', 4, 'xyz', 'abc', 4, 'xyz', 'c']

list.clear() --> clears the content
list.append() --> adds an element towards the end.
list.copy() --> Make a backup of the list.
# If you simply assign a list to another variable, it will become a copy by reference!

list.count(element) --> Counts the occurence of 'element' in the list.
len(list) --> gives the length of the list.
