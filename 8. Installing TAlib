1. Open this below link as given by praveen.

https://blog.quantinsti.com/install-ta-lib-python/

2. Then find the section of Alternate methods and select the choice based on your machine. I selected windows PC

3. Then next step is to open the below link (you will find this link in that site itself)

https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib

4. In that link search for TA-LIB.  you will find the list of whl files under TA-LIB section.
 I downloaded the below whl file as my computer is 64 bit

TA_Lib‑0.4.20‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl

5. Once it is downloaded, it will be in your machine. From that folder, you can copy into any folder you prefer.

6. Then in CMD prompt, go to that location folder which you stored the recent downloaded whl file.
   I hope you know the commands (cd folder name.. so on)
   Once you reached the exact folder location in command prompt, then type command
   pip install TA_Lib‑0.4.20‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl and enter

7. You will receive successfully installed notification.

8. To verify you can open python via CMD prompt or IDLE. Type import talib and enter. after sometime >>> next line tab will come.
    Thats the end of installation.
