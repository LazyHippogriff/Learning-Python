pip/pip3 -> It lets us install and uninstall packages. Use this for installing pipenv and after that never use it again. 
pipenv -> It has dependency manager and virtual environment support. It uses the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files to achieve these goals. 
Pipfile.lock is for computer while Pipfile is for humans.



# Install pip and pipenv
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev
pip3 install --user pipenv

# Add pipenv (and other python scripts) to PATH
echo "PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
